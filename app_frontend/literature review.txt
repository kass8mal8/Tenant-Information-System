Rental House Management System:
In a study published in the International Journal of Scientific and Research Publications, researchers explored the development of a Rental House Management System1.
The system aimed to simplify the work for rental managers by providing an efficient and effective solution.
Key features of the proposed system included:
Adding and managing house details: The administrator could add information about rental properties.
Tenant registration: The system facilitated tenant registration.
Handling rent payments: The system allowed tracking and management of rent payments.
Data manipulation: The system provided user-friendly forms with command buttons for tasks like adding, saving, deleting, and viewing data.
The motivation behind this system was to address the challenges faced by rental managers using manual methods, such as paper-based record-keeping and space constraints1.
Apartment Management System:
Another related area is apartment management. A review highlighted that while various services are provided by apartment management to residents, deficiencies still exist in the way these services are operated2.
Challenges faced by both residents and management include operational inefficiencies.
Developing efficient systems can improve the overall management experience for both parties.
Technology Adoption and Paradigm Shift:
The housing sector needs to embrace technology to overcome challenges.
The shift toward technology-driven solutions is essential for efficient tenant management.
The goal is to move away from cumbersome manual processes and adopt streamlined digital systems.
In summary, existing literature emphasizes the importance of user-friendly rental management systems that automate tasks, enhance data accuracy, and improve overall efficiency. These systems empower administrators, simplify tenant management, and contribute to a better housing experience for all stakeholders.
